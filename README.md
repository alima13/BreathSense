BreathSense 🌬️
Just a project to test the idea of having privacy guarantees within Respiratory Sounds Schema. Note the code is not complete yet! 

🌟 Overview
BreathSense is an experimental project aimed at leveraging privacy-preserving techniques in respiratory sound analysis. It combines machine learning architectures with federated learning to ensure data privacy while extracting meaningful insights from respiratory sounds.

✅ Core Implementation
Here are the key components of the project:

🎙️ Respiratory Acoustic Feature Extraction Pipeline: Extracting meaningful features from respiratory sound data.

🧠 CNN-LSTM Model Architecture: Deep learning model for respiratory sound classification.

🔑 LSH-Based Aggregation for Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving aggregation using Locality-Sensitive Hashing.

🤝 Federated Learning Training Framework: Distributed training without compromising user data privacy.

📂 ICBHI Dataset Handler: Efficient handling and preprocessing of the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics dataset.
